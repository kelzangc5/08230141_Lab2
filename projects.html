      <h3>Arduino Temperature Sensor Project</h3>
      <p>
        In our third semester, I participated in a group project to design and implement an Arduino-based system. The project focused on applying microcontroller programming and electronic circuit design to create a functional prototype that demonstrated practical applications of electronics and automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role involved coding the Arduino, assembling the hardware components, and testing the system to ensure proper functionality. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in electronics, problem-solving, and teamwork, while exploring how Arduino can be used to develop real-world solutions.

  <h3>VDT Video Project</h3>
  <p>
    In our third semester, I collaborated with a group of five members to create an educational video dramatization titled ‚ÄúInternet Adventure.‚Äù The project explored the world of the Internet through engaging storytelling, where characters such as the Internet Wizard, Guardians, and Hackers brought concepts to life in a creative and relatable way.
  </p>
  <p>
    My team and I scripted, acted, and dramatized the storyline to highlight the uses, advantages, disadvantages, and types of the Internet in an interactive format. To enhance the visual and technical quality, we used Adobe Photoshop for graphic design and video editing software for compiling, adding effects, and sound synchronization.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project allowed us to combine creativity, technical skills, and teamwork, while also showcasing how ICT tools can make learning more engaging and effective.

 <h3>Webdevelopment</h3>
<article>
  <p>
    This is an ongoing web development project aimed at creating a private blog platform exclusively for Samtse College students. The platform allows students to write, share, and read blogs, fostering collaboration, digital expression, and a sense of community within the college. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The project involves designing a user-friendly interface, implementing secure user authentication so only enrolled students can access and contribute, and organizing content effectively to make it easy to navigate. We are currently working on integrating features such as commenting, editing, and categorizing posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is helping us gain practical experience in **web development technologies**, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks, while applying best practices in UI/UX design, security, and database management. As the project progresses, we aim to create a robust, interactive, and secure platform that encourages students to share knowledge and ideas digitally.
